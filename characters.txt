Tom -  His hair was where his power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face.

Daisy - Just stood watching usâ€”a little jet-black woman. Her elbows stuck out like wings, and a huge white enameled tub occupied the space above her head, somewhat miraculously holding steady while her head moved in quick jerks to the right and left.

Jordan - He was a compact, clearcut man, with precise features, a lot of very soft black hair, and thoughtful dark brown eyes. He had a look of wariness, which could change when he felt relaxed or happy, which was not often in these difficult days, into a smile of amused friendliness and pleasure which aroused feelings of warmth, and something more, in many women.

Myrtle Wilson - A nice woman who cares about the problems her friend is going through. She tries to help by giving advice and listening to what her friend tells her.

George Wilson - Myrtle's husband is a huge guy, he is a business man and hardly has time for his wife. His hobby is golf and he often spends his spare time at the golf club with his friends to the displeasure of his wife.
